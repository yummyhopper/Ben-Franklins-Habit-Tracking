### How virtuous was I this semester?



### Introduction

In this R project I modify Ben Franklin's habit tracking method he outlined in his biography to analyze my semester in terms of virtue.

### Contents

- The data folder includes the self-reported data I used for this project. 
- The data_analysis folder includes the notebook I used to analyze my data. 
- The data_story folder includes a short blog post discussing my findings. 

### Data

This data was self-collected from a google form that I filled out every day. I was fairly inconsistent with filling out the form so I only ended up a little over a months worth of entries and I may not have always been the most reliable self-reporter as I usually filled out the form before going to bed a night. Nonetheless I found the insights somewhat aligned with my intuitions.

### Skills

- R (tidyverse)
- R (ggplot)
- Regression Analysis
