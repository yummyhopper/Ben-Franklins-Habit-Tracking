### How virtuous was I this semester?
In this R project I modify Ben Franklin's habit tracking method he outlined in his biography to analyze my semester in terms of virtue.
- The data folder includes the self-reported data I used for this project
- The data_analysis folder includes the notebook I used to break down my self-reported data
- The data_story folder includes a short blog post discussing my findings
