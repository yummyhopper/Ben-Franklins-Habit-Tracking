### Introduction

In Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography he lists thirteen virtues that occurred to him as necessary or desirable. Franklin describes how in pursuit of acquiring these thirteen virtues he would count his progress on a chart in order to track and stay accountable to his habit formation. Inspired by this idea I began to consider ways in which I could adapt his methods into a modern data science project. I wittled Franklin's thirteen down into a rounder ten -- silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, and tranquility -- and recorded how well I performed on each virtue during the past day on a scale from 1-10 over the course of the semester. I also included several external variables that I thought could have some sort of effect on my performance of the virtues such as if I ate well, if I exercised, and if I got less than eight hours of sleep. I began by exploring the categorical variables I would use to compare with my findings in the virtues section. All of these variables are boolean values i.e. True or False. For example, did you stay hydrated today? Yes/No. I then moved onto the continuous variables which were the ten virtues rated on a scale from 1-10 per day. For example, how frugal were you today on a scale from 1-10. Finally, I asked several questions of my data in order to seek out relationship and patterns I suspected might be occuring within the data. For example, did enjoying the weather effect my resolution? I used several types of plots and charts to answer these questions. 

### Contents

- The data folder includes the self-reported data I used for this project. 
- The data_analysis folder includes the notebook I used to analyze my data. 
- The data_story folder includes a short blog post discussing my findings. 

### Data

This data was self-collected from a google form that I filled out every day. I was fairly inconsistent with filling out the form so I only ended up a little over a months worth of entries and I may not have always been the most reliable self-reporter as I usually filled out the form before going to bed a night. Nonetheless I found the insights somewhat aligned with my intuitions.
